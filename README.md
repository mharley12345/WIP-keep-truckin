# Overview

Keep Truckin is an app made for truck drivers by a former truck driver. Keep truckin takes all the features that other map applications offer and uses them exclusively for vehicles over 80,000 lbs. Need a doctor in McHenry, IL that you can park your truck near? Or a barber in Ridley, Pa? Other applications will give you the address and directions to these places but will also have you on restricted routes or going under low bridges. Keep Truckin will tell you where you can legally park and the safest legal route to the destination or if there is none.

### Problem Statement

- Truck Driving is a stressfully job. Finding a doctor , barber , decent meal or a safe place to park when in non rural areas shouldn't have to be.

### Proposed Solution

- Create an application that takes all of the extra leg work out for the driver and does it automatically .
